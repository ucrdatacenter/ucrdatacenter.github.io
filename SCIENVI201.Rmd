# Working with R and RStudio

## Recommended reading

It is highly recommended that you read the sections 2, 3.1-3.4 and 4-6 of [A (very) short introduction to R](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/A\%20(very)\%20short\%20introduction\%20to\%20R.pdf) and sections 1-4 of [How to make any plot in ggplot2?](http://r-statistics.co/ggplot2-Tutorial-With-R.html#6.1\%20Make\%20a\%20time\%20series\%20plot\%20(using\%20ggfortify)) before starting working with R. 

## Installing R and RStudio

R is the programming language that you use when working with data.
RStudio is a development environment that makes working with R much more convenient.
Both are free to download and install.

To download R, go to [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and follow the instructions on the page.
To download RStudio, go to [rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), scroll down and download the file recommended for your operating system.

When installing, you can always stick to the default settings, unless you have different preferences.

In case you get stuck at any point, or would like more guidance in the installation process, feel free to check out any of the following links:

* [Tutorial: Getting Started with R and RStudio](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/tutorial-getting-started-with-r-and-rstudio/)
* [R Tutorial: How to install R and R studio (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Qu7Jg1Jw5A)
       
## Creating a project in RStudio

It is convenient to create an R project for an assignment that you are working on.
A project is basically a folder that stores all files related to the assignment.

You can create a project as follows:

* Open RStudio and click on "Project: (None)" in the top right corner.
* Open the dropdown window and click on "New Project...."
* In the popup window select "New Directory", then "New Project."
* Choose a sensible name for your project and enter it as the Directory Name. You can either use the default file path or change it by clicking "Browse..." next to "Create project as a subdirectory of:."
* Finally, click on "Create project."

After a project is created, there are two easy ways of accessing it. 
You can either use the same dropdown window in the top right corner of RStudio that you used to create the project, and click on the name of the project there, or you can find the project folder within your files and click on the file with the .Rproj extension.

  ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84587448/144092109-7298977c-a6af-4146-9dde-54d51b3741b4.jpg)
  
  Nitrogen deposition is one of the main causes of current biodiversity decline (Payne, et a., 2013). This is mainly due to highly intensified agricultural practices which are very common, here, in the Netherlands. Therefore, environmentalists and ecologists have had numerous debates in recent years on how to analyze and tackle this biodiversity decline due to Nitrogen. What is the response of individual species to increasing Nitrogen levels? Which species are negatively impacted and might some even benefit? As an ecologist, you need to know what is the species distribution and how does it correlate with increasing Nitrogen deposition levels to be able to draw the right conclusion and to suggest appropriate action plans for species protection. In this assignment you will work with external source of species occurrences, will correlate these to Nitrogen deposition in the Netherlands and perform a statistical test to see what relationship there is between Nitrogen deposition and the occurrences of a chosen species.
  
  
## DATA
  
  Data on organism occurrences can be directly downloaded in a csv file from [gbif.com](gbif.com).\
  Data on nitrogen deposition levels in the Netherlands can be downloaded from RIVM website: [rivm.nl](https://www.rivm.nl/gcn-gdn-kaarten/depositiekaarten/cijfers-achter-depositiekaarten/gdn-depositiebestanden-achterliggende-jaren).
  
  
## LEARNING OUTCOMES
  While completing this assignment, a student can gain practice in performing research with data from an external source as well as develop multiple R skills such as: 
  
* obtaining and importing data from an online source to R, 
* filtering and adjusting data to reach a set of desired information only,
* visualizing species occurrences and Nitrogen deposition levels,
* visualizing graphs in R, 
* performing statistical test.
  
  
## RESEARCH FOCUS
  What is the relationship between species occurrences and Nitrogen deposition levels?

# Instructions

These assignment instructions serve you as a guide in completing your original assignment. Here, I will walk you step by step through an example of the assignment. Once you complete this, you can start with your own variation of the assignment. Creativity is very welcome. 
In your version of the assignment you choose:
  
  - species of an interest
  - year (of Nitrogen deposition and species ocurrences).

<center>
# **The correlation between Chaffinch, _Fringilla coelebs_, and Nitrogen deposition levels in the Netherlands** {.unlisted .unnumbered}

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84587448/148916498-2fb3d7c6-5d03-4c85-9a0f-68f5efff1efe.jpg)
</center>

At this step it is assumed that you have:

* installed R, 
* Rstudio (the working environment for R language), 
* created an R project for this assignment, 
* read the recommended reading.

Now, open the R project you have created according to the instructions above. Rstudio interface consists of four windows. Top right is the environment window storing the data and values currently in R memory. Bottom right is the plots,  packages, and help window. Bottom left is the console window where you can type commands which R will execute without saving them. Top left is the script window which holds collections of commands which can be edited and saved. In this assignment we will write our code in the top left window, R Script file. If you cannot see this window click File on the top left -> New File -> R Script.\
A note before we dive into the assignment: if you have troubles understanding a code, the easiest way how to learn more about it is typing ?codename into the console and pressing enter. For example ?library() or ?ggplot().

## LIBRARIES

An R library or a R package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that allows you for a clean workflow. To be able to access a package you first need to install it with the code _install.packages(...)_. You only need to install a package once. However, in order to be able to work with the packages in your RStudio environment you need to load them with the code _library(...)_. It is a good practice to have your libraries loaded on the top of your R Script so you can always come back to your code knowing which libraries you used. 

In this assignment we will be using the following packages. 

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("tabularaster")
install.packages("terra")
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("tidymodels")

```

The next step is to load the libraries in your Rstudio, so they are ready to be used. 
Every section has a comment which says which library you are using to keep an overview.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(tabularaster)
library(terra)
library(sf)
library(readr)
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)

```

## DATA IMPORT

#### Nitrogen data

Go to the website: [rivm.nl](https://www.rivm.nl/gcn-gdn-kaarten/depositiekaarten/cijfers-achter-depositiekaarten/gdn-depositiebestanden-achterliggende-jaren), and download **total Nitrogen deposition (Total stikstof (N))** from the year 2018 (ndep 2018). Once downloaded, you can see that the data is in a zipped file which cannot be worked with in RStudio. Therefore, _extract all_ with the right click, and save the extracted data into a new created file called Data in your Project folder. I renamed the file from depo_ntot_2018 to nitrogen for a simple overview, but you can order your files according to your own preferences. However, remember to update your code according to your files' names. Now, we can import the data on nitrogen deposition levels to our RStudio. We will do so with the code _rast(...)_ which imports data from a raster file. Raster file stores image data in a matrix of cells organized in rows and columns. Next, we want to call this imported data Nitrogen_2018. We do so with the symbol _<-_. If the importing was successful we should see Nitrogen_2018 data in our global environment (top right window).

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}

# library used: library(terra)
Nitrogen_2018 <- rast("C:/Users/PC/Documents/GitHub/projects/SCIENVI201/2022h1/Data/nitrogen/depo_ntot_2018.asc")

```

Let's see how does the Nitrogen deposition map looks like. At first, we tell R which data do we want to work with, Nitrogen_2018. Now, looking at the code, we can see that we connect multiple functions with this magical %>% sign. This symbol %>% is called a pipe. A pipe allows us to connect multiple operations in a simple format so it is easy to understand and read. If you are interested in reading more about pipes, you can do so [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html). Next, we rewrite the Nitrogen_2018 data into a data frame, table structure of data. Followingly, we rewrite into a tibble, a simple version of data frame which only shows first 10 rows of a data set. Now, we can see our tibble in the console. Specifically, we can see three variables:

* x variable (longitude), 
* y variable (latitude), 
* depo_ntot_2018 variable (the level of deposition in mol/(ha.yea)).

```{r echo = TRUE, message = TRUE}

# library used: library(tidyverse)
Nitrogen_2018 %>% 
  as.data.frame(xy = T) %>% 
  as_tibble() 

```

Now, having understood the structure of our data, we move forward with visualizing it. To previous lines of code we attach a ggplot. As you have read in your recommended reading, ggplot is a graphical framework for R. Our data set is only known and therefore we do not need to specify it anymore in the ggplot() line of code. However, we still need to specify the aesthetic mapping, the x and y coordinates of our graph. In our case, it is simple as our variables are called x (longitude) and y (latitude). Our third aesthetic is a fill argument which enables us to visualize a third variable, in our case, the level of nitrogen. Once we defined which variables we wanted to use we choose how do we want to visualize them. Since our data is in a raster format we will use geom_raster().

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
 
# library used: library(tidyverse)
Nitrogen_2018 %>% 
  as.data.frame(xy = T) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = depo_ntot_2018)) + 
  geom_raster()

```

#### Species data

Go to the website: [gbif.org](gbif.org), click get data (toolbar on the top) and select occurrences. Now select, the occurrences of your species in your preferred region. Go to the toolbar on the left, under Scientific name type: **Fringilla coelebs**, in Year select: **2018**, and finally in Country or area select: **Netherlands**. Click DOWNLOAD, create an account, and select SIMPLE in download options. This step might take a little while, as the request needs to be processed. In the meantime create a chaffinch folder in your Data folder where you will store all the information on your species. Once the file is ready, click download, and save the data. It is again a zipped file which needs to be extracted. With the right click select _extract all_ and save the data into chaffinch file in the Data folder. As a last step, rename the extracted csv file to chaffinch_2018. Now, we can import the data on chaffinch, _Fringilla coelebs_, to our Rstudio. There are two ways how to do this. One of them is selecting Files in your bottom right window in RStudio -> Data -> chaffinch_2018 -> Import Dataset... -> selecting Tab in the Delimeter options in the bottom toolbar -> import. Second option how to import the data is by using the code _read_delim("pathway", delim = "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trm_ws = TRUE)_ as indicated below. The argument delim = "\t" means that our data is separated by a tab. Similarly to how we named the nitrogen data, we now call our species occurrences data Chaffinch_2018 with the symbol <_.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# library used: library(readr)
Chaffinch_2018 <- read_delim("C:/Users/PC/Documents/GitHub/projects/SCIENVI201/2022h1/Data/chaffinch/chaffinch_2018.csv", 
                             delim = "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)

```

Let's view the data set on chaffinch. This can be simply done either by clicking on Chaffinch_2018 in the global environment or by using code _view()_.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}

Chaffinch_2018 %>% view()

```

Looking at the data set, we can see that it is quiet extensive having 50 columns and over 60000 observations (rows). We can also notice how are coordinate variables (longitude and latitude) called as we will need it in the next step. Now, we will visualize our species occurrences on a map so we have an idea of their distribution. This time, we need to specify the data we want to visualize in ggplot() as data = ... argument. We want to see occurrences points on a coordinate map, in other words, dots on a graph. Therefore, we will choose geom_point() as a layer how to visualize our plot. Our mapping aesthetics are for x coordinate longitude (decimalLongitude) and for y coordinate latitude (decimalLatitude)

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# library used: library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = Chaffinch_2018) +
  geom_point(aes(x = decimalLongitude, y = decimalLatitude))

```

We could have seen that the data set is quiet big. However, we do not need all the information. Therefore, in the next step we will clean our data set to our preferred size.

## DATA TIDYING

For the following part of the assignment please read Introduction to [Spatial Data and Analysis in R](https://wec.wur.nl/r/spatial/introduction.html), sections 1.1 and 1.2.

In this following code we select the variables with which we will be working: species names (species), longitude (decimalLongitude), and latitude (decimalLatitude) with the code _select()_. Furthermore, we omit all the unknown variables to avoid errors later on with the code _na.omit()_. As a last step, we convert our data frame Chaffinch_2018 into an sf object. This simply means that our spatial coordinate variables, the latitude and longitude, will be merged from two variable into one variable. 

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}

# library used: library(tidyverse) and library(sf)
Chaffinch_2018 <- Chaffinch_2018 %>%
  dplyr::select(species, decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude) %>% # in this case you can notice that we wrote down dplyr::select instead of just typing command select(). This is because the command select() is in two of our libraries. Therefore, we wanted to specify that this select is from dplyr package which is within tidyverse.
  na.omit() %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("decimalLongitude","decimalLatitude")) 
  
```

When working with geo-spatial data, we can come across various versions of coordinate systems. Therefore, our next step is to check whether our two geo-spatial data (Nitrogen and Chaffinch) is in the same coordinate system. The code _crs(data)_ tells us in which coordinate system the geo-spatial data is. Here, the Nitrogen deposition file does not have it defined, but reading the information on the data set we know that the data set is in Amersfoort coordinate system. Therefore, we can tell the Nitrogen_2018 that it is in this format. Similarly, all data occurrences from global biodiversity information facility (gbif) are recorded in gobal geographic coordinate system WGS84 (EPSG:4326). Therefore, we can also set the coordinate system to Chaffinch_2018. 

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}

# libraries used: library(sf) and library(terra)
crs(Nitrogen_2018) <- "+init=epsg:28992"
st_crs(Chaffinch_2018) <- "+init=epsg:4326"

```

Next we can transform the chaffinch coordinate system into the same coordinate system as Nitrogen_2018 with the code _st_transform()_.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

Chaffinch_2018 <- st_transform(Chaffinch_2018, 28992)

```

Now, we do not only want to be able to see our data on a graph but also in a numeric data set. In another words, we want to see which geo-spatial point belongs to which Nitrogen level and the number of species occurring. Therefore, here we want to merge these two files (Nitrogen_2018 and Chaffinch_2018) and write it into a table complete_data. We can do this with the code _extract()_. How does that work? Imagine having two paper maps laying on top of each other on a table. Now, you take a pin and you pin it across both of the papers from top down. R takes the information from both of the maps on this exact place where the pin was pinned and stores it in a row. Once extracted it you store this information in a tibble. In the next step we want to add a variable to the complete_data table which an be done with the code _mutate()_.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}

#library used: library(terra)

complete_data <- terra::extract(Nitrogen_2018, vect(Chaffinch_2018), cells = T, xy = T) %>% as_tibble() 

complete_data <- complete_data %>% 
  mutate(species = "Fringilla coelebs")

```


## PLOTTING
Once, we have our data sets available we would like to look at a graph which would show us whether there is some relationship between the level of Nitrogen and species occurrences. In the following lines of code, we have three various graphs and you need to justify yourself which one is the most informative.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# BOXPLOT
ggplot(data = complete_data) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = depo_ntot_2018)) +
  labs(x = "Chaffinch, Fringilla coelebs (n)",
      y = "Nitrogen deposition (mol/(ha.year))")

# HISTOGRAM
ggplot(data = complete_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = depo_ntot_2018), binwidth = 100) +
  labs(x = "Nitrogen deposition (mol/(ha.year))",
      y = "Chaffinch, Fringilla coelebs (n)")

# FREQUENCY POLYGON
ggplot(data = complete_data) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = depo_ntot_2018), binwidth = 100) +
  labs(title = "Species occurences per Nitrogen deposition",
       x = "Nitrogen deposition (mol/(ha.year))",
       y = "Chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) (n)")


```

## STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

library used: _library(tidyverse)_ and _library(tidymodels)_

After visually observing the relationship, we want to see the quantitative analysis of the relationship.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

## writing a table t with x (nitrogen levels) and y (species frequency) variables
t <- complete_data %>% 
  mutate(bins = round(depo_ntot_2018, digits = -2)) %>% 
  group_by(bins) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  rename(x = bins,
         y = n) %>% 
  na.omit()

## visualizing the relationship
ggplot(data = t, aes(x = x, y = y, group = 1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Species occurences per Nitrogen deposition",
       x = "Nitrogen deposition (mol/(ha.year))",
       y = "Chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) (n)")

```

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

## library needed: library(tidymodels)
## statistical resutls
lm(y ~ poly(x, 2), t) %>%
  tidy()

```
