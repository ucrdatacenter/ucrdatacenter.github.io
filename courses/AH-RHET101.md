# Introduction

This page collects materials for the data-driven assignment in the
Spring 2025 edition of Introduction to Rhetoric and Argumentation at
UCR. You can also access the related files (data and R scripts) directly
on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ucrdatacenter/projects/tree/main/AH-RHET101/2025h1).

# Office hours

The Data Center offers office hours to help you with the data-driven
assignments. You can find more information about the schedule
[here](../../contact).

# Preparation for Data Center workshops

To participate in the workshops, you will need to have R and RStudio
installed on your computer. If you don’t have these programs installed,
please follow [this installation tutorial](../../tutorials/r_install).

In addition, the [R basics tutorial](../../../tutorials/r_basics) on the
Data Center website explains the RStudio interface, and shows how to
create a new project and how to install packages.
